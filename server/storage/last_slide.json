    "A diagram illustrating the basic structure of a neuron and its connections. Key parts like the cell body, axon, dendrites, synapse, and presynaptic terminal are clearly labeled. The diagram shows one central neuron connecting to the dendrites and presynaptic terminals of other neurons, demonstrating how neurons form interconnected networks."
